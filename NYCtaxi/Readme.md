# New York City Taxi Data Exploration

This is one of the kaggle competitions.

## Competition Description ([from kaggle web site])

In this competition, Kaggle is challenging you to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Your primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

Longtime Kagglers will recognize that this competition objective is similar to the ECML/PKDD trip time challenge we hosted in 2015. But, this challenge comes with a twist. Instead of awarding prizes to the top finishers on the leaderboard, this playground competition was created to reward collaboration and collective learning.

We are encouraging you (with cash prizes!) to publish additional training data that other participants can use for their predictions. We also have designated bi-weekly and final prizes to reward authors of kernels that are particularly insightful or valuable to the community.

## Data
The competition dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this playground competition. Based on individual trip attributes, participants should predict the duration of each trip in the test set.
